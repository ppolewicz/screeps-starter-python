# TODO: special mode to build containers for mining
# when building a container, check if it's next to a source. If it is, try to reserve it and stand on it, then mine and build alternating ticks
# of we can't stand on it, try to find some other non-wall place next to the source that is close enough to the container to be able to build it and do the same
# otherwise do the regular thing harvesters do

# have virtual construction sites

# build roads from controller to the sources from farthest to closest (starting at source side), then to spawn
